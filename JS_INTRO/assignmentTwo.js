// // Create a command line-based guessing game, the game should guess a random number between 1 and 10, accept your input (a number you guess within the range of 1 to 10), compare your input with the random number generated.


// // If the inputs are same, the output should be “You have won!”
 
// // If the imputs are not the same the output should be “You have lost! The random number generated is <randomNumber>”.

// // "<randomNumber>" is a placeholder (where the random number generated by NodeJS should be placed).
